      <p>We may now live in a world of Facebook, Pokémon Go, Netflix and iPads, but board-gaming is booming. Even the early 20th-century games explosion, which gave us such hardy perennials as Monopoly, Cluedo and Scrabble, has nothing on the current surge. Market research group NPD, which claims to measure around 70% of the UK toy trade, has recorded a 20% rise during the past year in the sales of tabletop games (including card and dice games, war games played with miniature figures and role-play titles such as Dungeons & Dragons, in which players imagine themselves as heroic warriors and wizards in imaginary, fantasy worlds).</p>
      <p>Ben Hogg, marketing manager at UK distributor Esdevium Games (which imports the US-produced railway adventure Ticket to Ride, among many other titles) estimates that growth at closer to 35%. In 2012, he says, the full range of Ticket to Ride games (there are variants set in different countries) achieved 16,000 sales in the UK. This year, it has already sold 21,000. When he started at Esdevium, Hogg says the gamers they supplied were primarily interested in “geekier titles”, such as fantasy war game Warhammer. Today, he says, “we are seeing a much bigger crossover audience. The level of interest is much higher than ever before.”</p>
      <p>Few have been better positioned to witness this phenomenon first-hand than Peter Wooding. A former punk rocker – he played guitar in 70s band The Jerks (who broke into the Top 100 in 1977 with Get Your Woofing Dog Off Me) – he opened the gaming store Orc’s Nest in Covent Garden, London, in 1987. He and Jerks lead singer Simon Ellis were hooked on Dungeons & Dragons and tabletop war games. But specialist retailers were rare, so they put in an offer on a small, semi-constructed shop space. “There wasn’t even a floor,” Wooding says. “It was all just rubble.” They raided skips to decorate the shop’s interior in medieval dungeon style and scattered straw over the unfinished floor. They mostly stocked Dungeons & Dragons books and historical war games, but their best sellers were lead war-gaming miniatures, which dangled from boards lining the store’s ground-floor walls.</p>
      <p>“The first few years we were absolutely skint,” says Wooding (Ellis has retired) as we chat behind the counter at Orc’s Nest. Wearing a straw hat and decorated with facial piercings, the garrulous, imperially bearded 50-something is proud of his punk heritage. “We got investigated by the tax office. They said, ‘Why are you doing this? You’re only making 50 quid a week!’ They thought we must have been embezzling the money or something…”</p>
